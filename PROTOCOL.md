##How to carry out a ban:
* Verify that the ban is appropriate for the offence which took place, a ban is not considered appropriate if there is insufficient evidence to prove the player guilty.
* Check the Ban System to see if the user has any previous recorded offences. If any, take those into account when performing the ban.
* If possible, check with other members of the team as to include a second (or even a third) opinion.
* Upload screenshot proof to Imgur, be sure that the entire Minecraft window is visible.
* For video proof, upload as an unlisted video to YouTube.
* Execute the appropriate command to perform the ban. Be sure to attach the proof of offence to the ban.
* Check the Ban System once again to see if the ban was processed correctly. If not, correct it in the Ban System.
* If there are any issues or extreme circumstances, contact your team leader.

##How to carry out temporary bans:
* Verify that the ban is appropriate for the offence which took place.
* If possible, check with other members of the team as to include a second (or even a third) opinion.
* Check the Ban System to see if the user has any previous recorded offences.
* If any, take those into account when performing the ban.
* Execute the command /tempban to perform the ban (see command formatting below)
* Check the Ban System once again to see if the ban was processed correctly.
* If not, /unban and repeat.
